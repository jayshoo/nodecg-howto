Getting started with NodeCG can be overwhelming.
Here's my own quick guide to doing NodeCG stuff.

# let's set up...
## our development environment
* windows 10 x64
* [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [git for windows cli](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (ensure it's added to PATH)
* [nodejs runtime](https://nodejs.org) (v10 recommended)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (.msi installer recommended)

Visual Studio Code is a great, free, lightweight IDE inspired by the likes of Sublime and Atom.
Git is a version control system - NodeCG depends on git, but we'll use it ourselves too.
NodeJS is a server that runs Javascript code.
Yarn is a Javascript package manager, an alternative to the `npm` package manager that ships with NodeJS.

## NodeCG
* install nodecg-cli, globally
* make a project folder
* nodecg setup into that folder

## ...and let's make sure it works
